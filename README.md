# SUMMARY
The **FOOOXYS** Project involves the creation of robots with disruptive innovative approaches.

# PROJECT
The **FOOOXYS** (Flexible Overall Orientation Optimized eXtreme System) project consists of developing autonomous mobile robots to carry out supervision and inspection activities in a flexible and decentralized way in different types of complex environments (industrial, agribusiness or social), in a integrated existing technologies, machinery and systems (as in Industry 4.0 which uses a sensor network, IoT devices, Wireless, WiTricity, Big Data, ML, BI and other technologies), with a focus on optimizing processes and decision making.

# TITLE
FLEXIBLE MONITORING AND DATA ACQUISITION SYSTEM USING AUTONOMOUS MOBILE ROBOTS

# DESCRIPTION
The solution consists of an integrated system where small passive sensing devices inserted in the field collect the necessary information (such as consumption or environmental variables) and store it in an internal memory. These devices in turn transmit the information collected through RFID tags to autonomous mobile robots whose main objective is to search decentralized data collection devices in a flexible and coherent way. The robots forward the data via wireless communication to a data analysis and consolidation center. This center is also responsible for programming the robots' high-level logistical command. The analysis center delivers the data to a BI (Business Intelligence) interface for subsequent management analysis and also to a SCADA Supervisory System (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) with an HMI (Human-Machine Interface) for real-time control of the process of collecting data from robots.
